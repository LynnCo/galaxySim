<h1>make_galaxy</h1>

<h3>Currently rewriting!</h3>

Simulates galaxy formation / generation via gas / star behavior in a region of space, via equations for gravitational and diffusive force (or simplified versions thereof). The simlation is a representation of two or more galaxies feeding gas / stars into a region of space. The data is representated in an array such that [x,y] = [mass, x velocity, y velocity]. Those qualities are then iterated upon to create the model. The goal of this project is to computationally produce an approximation of a spiral galaxy.
